# Saving Plan Generator – SCRUM

This repository contains a **web application for generating personalized savings plans**, developed as an **academic project** applying the **SCRUM agile methodology** and pre-established processes.

The system allows the user to enter their personal data, income, expenses, and a financial goal, and then calculates different possible savings plans based on their financial situation.

---

## Project Objective

- Apply the **SCRUM methodology** in software development.
- Analyze and validate financial data provided by the user.
- Calculate viable savings plans based on income, expenses, and timeframe.
- Display the results in the form of a **clear and understandable report**.
- Reinforce the use of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** in a real project.

This project was developed as part of the Software Engineering course, with the objective of practically applying the SCRUM methodology in a web development project.



## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Application structure and forms
- **JavaScript** – Logic, validations, and calculations
- **Visual Studio Code** - IDE
- **Live Server**
- **Google Chrome**

## Main Features

- User personal data capture
- Age of majority validation
- Monthly income and expense registration
- Expense classification by importance
- Monthly balance calculation
- Savings plan generation:
  - With a defined timeframe (3, 6, or 12 months)
  - With an extended timeframe if the original goal cannot be met
  - Expense reduction suggestions
- Generation of a final report in table format


## SCRUM Methodology Applied

The project development was divided into **three sprints**:

### Sprint 1

- Data collection and validation through forms
- Definition of variables and data structures
- Sending and receiving data between pages

### Sprint 2

- Calculation of total expenses and monthly balance
- Evaluation of goal feasibility
- Logic for alternative savings plans

### Sprint 3

- Age of majority validation
- Presentation of results in HTML tables
- Final report generation
- Footer with author information
